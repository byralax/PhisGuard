        <h1>PhishGuard Privacy Policy</h1>
      </div>
    </div>
    
    <p>At PhishGuard, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how our browser extension collects, uses, and protects your information as you use our service to protect yourself from phishing attacks.</p>
    
    <div class="highlight">
      <strong>Summary:</strong> PhishGuard is designed to protect you from phishing websites while respecting your privacy. We collect minimal data necessary to provide this service, never sell your personal information, and give you control over what data is collected.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    
    <h3>URLs You Visit</h3>
    <p>PhishGuard checks the URLs of websites you visit against databases of known phishing sites. This is necessary to provide our core service of protecting you from phishing attacks.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not store a history of the websites you visit on our servers</li>
      <li>URL checking is performed locally or through secure API calls to phishing databases</li>
      <li>Only suspicious URLs that are confirmed as phishing sites may be reported to improve our detection systems</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Website Content</h3>
    <p>When you visit a website, PhishGuard may analyze the content of the page to detect phishing indicators such as:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Suspicious forms requesting sensitive information</li>
      <li>Brand impersonation attempts</li>
      <li>Hidden elements that might be capturing data</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This analysis is performed locally in your browser. We do not store or transmit the content of websites you visit.</p>
    
    <h3>Usage Statistics</h3>
    <p>If enabled in settings (on by default), we collect anonymous usage statistics to help improve the extension:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Number of websites checked</li>
      <li>Number of phishing attempts blocked</li>
      <li>Types of phishing attacks detected</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This data is aggregated and cannot be used to identify individual users or browsing habits.</p>
    
    <h3>User-Provided Information</h3>
    <p>You may optionally provide information when:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Reporting a suspected phishing site (including your email if you choose to provide it)</li>

    <h3>Third-Party Phishing Databases</h3>
    <p>PhishGuard uses third-party services like PhishTank and Google Safe Browsing to check URLs. When you visit a website, the URL may be sent to these services to check if it's a known phishing site. These services have their own privacy policies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://www.phishtank.com/privacy.php" target="_blank">PhishTank Privacy Policy</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google Privacy Policy</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Reported Phishing Sites</h3>
    <p>When you report a phishing site through the extension, the URL and your description of the site (but not your personal information) may be shared with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Our phishing database</li>
      <li>Partner anti-phishing organizations</li>
      <li>Relevant authorities in cases of serious fraud</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="warning">
      <strong>Note:</strong> If you provide your email address when reporting a site, it will only be used to contact you for additional information if needed and will not be shared with third parties.
    </div>
    
    <h2>Your Choices and Controls</h2>

    </ul>
    
    <p>You can access these settings by clicking on the PhishGuard icon in your browser toolbar and selecting "Settings".</p>
    
    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    
    <p>We implement appropriate security measures to protect your information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>All communication with our servers and third-party APIs uses secure HTTPS connections</li>
      <li>API keys are stored securely in your browser's local storage</li>
      <li>We regularly review our security practices to ensure your data remains protected</li>
    </ul>
